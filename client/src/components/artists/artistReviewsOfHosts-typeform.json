I’m guessing this is why, but everything was a little chaotic leading up to the concert. There weren’t enough chairs for folks unfortunately and because she was managing a lot it didn’t feel as though folks were welcomed as well as they could have been. Also, there needed to be a different acknowledgement and placement of the donation job. I felt like we discussed this, but in the moment with the chaos, felt like I may have been able to do a better job with those details.",

I don't usually like to perform at churches (for various reasons) but I'm glad I decided not to cancel this event. Jim and the audience at H20 were so welcoming and kind. I was not pressured to be anything other than I am. I have already spoken to Jim about coming back. I highly recommend the space. I suggest they get a dedicated sound engineer, but I was able to set myself up no problem.",

I would play Gallery South again in a second. My only criticism is that I would like to be involved more in the roster of artists joining me on the bill next time. Although we were all drawing from the same well, I felt Melanie was more of a worship leader than performing songwriter. I don’t mix those two things. It’s just something I don’t do. So next time, I’d like to be a part of that curation if possible. Not a criticism of Porchlight, Gallery South or even Melanie…I just get prickly about the distinction between worship/performance. Over all, I was encouraged and was so thankful to be a part of this evening.",

I’d be interested to see if she’d be willing to host inside another time, too. There is a all season room thing that is cozy and could be arranged to make a mini concert space.
